UNKNOWN SPOOFER SHOULD WORK IN VALORANT. WE HAD A FEW TESTERS AND IT WAS WORKING IN 90% OFF ALL TESTERS

What you should do for best results is make a new windows user account and log into that and use that to spoof.

However, if you don't it should just be used like

Spoof - Restarts computer after spoofing - Start the game and log into new account.
If you restart again, on next boot the spoof driver will not load again so you would have to spoof again
